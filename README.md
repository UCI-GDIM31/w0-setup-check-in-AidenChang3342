# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

1-1: 
    Hello! My name is Wooseong Chang, but you can call me Aiden. I really like playing story-driven RPGs like Persona, as well as a large variety of indie games such as Roguelikes and Platformers!(SANABI, Hollow Knight, Deadcells, Skul, etc.) 

    I am taking this class because I want to properly learn the terms and the process in which Game Development works. I have tried to do multiple game projects in the past, but I am not sure where to start or how to proceed as there are so many aspects that I needed to learn from, which took a lot of time. I have had a little experience with school projects in terms of very simple games such as platformers (That were always unfinished :P ). I would love to learn how to build RPG games of either Turn-Based or Platformers!



2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)


2-1: 
    I am a Game Design & Interactive Media Major, but I am considering changing majors.


3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?


3-1:
    I am hoping to learn the very first process to the end process of submitting a game, and EVERYTHING in between. I tend to have more success if there is a framework I could first start with, and know what I am going to be doing. 



4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?


4-1: 
    I am a little nervous about the extent to which I will be able to properly complete the assignements as well as communicating with peers, but hopefully I will be able to get over it quickly! : D



## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

1-1: 
    Little bit of Python and GDScript 
    Little bit of Java 

2. Game development (any engine)

2-1: 
    Very very very little of Unity
    Very very little of Godot 

3. Unity

3-1: 
    Very very very little of unity, where I partipated in Video Game Development Club @ Georgia Tech but mostly helped with Story/Game Elements


### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
1-1: 
    I believe a game design document is an overview of what the game is, its directors, and basically a brief summary of the genre and how it is going to be played. 

2. Scope management

2-1: 
    N/A

3. Iteration

3-1: 
    I think Iternations are used when there are multiple versions of something, where in Game Development, there are going to be multiple iterations of a game as seen with Version numbers such as 1.0.3. 


4. Object-Oriented programming

4-1:
    I believe Java utilized OOP a lot, where there are classes, methods that are parent or child of another class. It is seperated into Objects where it is like an entity or a "block" of code that can do a method or something.

5. Model-View-Controller architecture

5-1: 
    N/A
